This directory houses the HTML documentation for lipidimea that is embedded 
into the GUI application. The documentation is generated using Sphinx and 
documentation configuration/source files are in the docs/ top-level directory.
Use "make docs" in the gui/ top-level directory to automatically build the 
HTML docs and copy them into here so that they can be embedded in the GUI 
application.
